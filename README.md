# Audio Mute

Audio Mute is a simple program that allows you to toggle the mute state of a windows sound device using your own defined hotkeys.

It also includes a push-to-talk feature.

Default hotkeys include:

Right-Alt = Toggle Mute

Shift-Q = Change Mode

Shift-T = Disable Hotkey Detection

## Installing

### Windows

Download the latest [Audio Mute release](https://github.com/JamesLowther/Audio-Mute/releases/latest).

Extract `audiomute-windows.zip` to your desired location.

Run `Audio Mute.exe` to launch the program. It will appear in your system tray.

To run Audio Mute on system boot, create a shortcut of `Audio Mute.exe` and place it in your startup folder.

A guide to find the startup folder can be found [here](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/startup-folder-in-windows-8).

This is my first publically released coding project, so bugs are to be expected.

Thanks!
