Hotkey Prefixes:

# Win (eg. #F = win-F)
! Alt (eg. !UP = alt-up key)
^ Ctrl (eg. ^Q = ctrl-Q)
+ Shift (eg. +H = shift-H)
& Used to string multiple keys together (eg. G & UP = G and UP key)
~ Will still allow the system to use the hotkey. Otherwise it will be reserved for Audio Mute (eg. ~^A)
* Wildcard: Fire the hotkey even if extra modifiers are being held down. (eg. *+Y)
